🛠 Important Guidelines
📌 General Rules
✅ Use only logical properties instead of physical properties wherever applicable.
✅ Apply the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle—use common classes for elements with similar styling instead of writing repetitive CSS.

🎯 Universal Reset
 ◾ Apply a universal reset for padding, margin, and set box-sizing to border-box.

📏 Set Dimensions for Body

 ◾ This ensures the body covers the entire viewport and prevents unexpected spacing issues.

🖋️ Font Settings
 ◾ Set font-family: sans-serif;
👉 dimensions for logo is : width-50px height-50px
👉 Dimensions for illustration is : width-550px height-500px
👉 Dimensions for mail logo which is inside input field is : width-30px height-30px

✨ Hover & Interaction Effects
✔️ Navbar Items (Home, Services, About Us):

 ◾ On Hover: background-color: #4d5ee8;
 ◾ Apply border-radius & cursor: pointer.
✔️ Footer Links: Change color to rgb(197, 190, 190) on hover.

✔️ Before Pseudo-Element for h1:

 ◾  Add 🖥️ before the h1 using the ::before pseudo-element.
📏 Layout & Alignment (Flexbox & Grid)
✅ Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to align items properly in:

✔️ Alignment
 ◾ Align the elements of footer and the main container using flex or grid accordingly.

🖼️ Blending Image with Background
 ◾ Use the mix-blend-mode property to merge the image with the background for a seamless effect.

✅ Steps to Apply mix-blend-mode: multiply;

 ◾ Ensure the body has a background color set. 
 ◾ Then select the image and set mix-blend-mode: multiply
 ◾ This will blend the image with the background instead of appearing as a separate layer.

🎯 Final Notes
 ◾ Use Flexbox/Grid for proper layout structuring.
 ◾ Ensure your styles match the reference design.
 ◾ Use proper semantic HTML and maintain clean, structured CSS.
