ðŸ‘‰Bugs folder consist of two style files one is starter file which must be shared with students and another one is output file that contains the solution code.
ðŸ‘‰fix-1: students have to set the flex-dirction: column and give some gap: 20px then everything will look perfect and good to go.
ðŸ‘‰The real problem will start when they change the direction of web, go to body selector and then set dirction to rtl that is dirction: rtl, once this is done, have a look to your website and that is when we will see the issue.
ðŸ‘‰fix-2: to fix this issue change the physical properties to logical properties and done.
ðŸ‘‰Lastly, set the writing-mode: veritcal-rl and see if your website is matching with the output-2.png .
ðŸ‘‰Here, the main idea is your website should adapt its styling even if you change the dirction and writing-mode.
ðŸ‘‰In the default dirction that is left-to-right, your website should match with output-1 image adn when the dirction is set to right-to-left and writing-mode is set to vertical-rl, your website should match with output-2 image.
